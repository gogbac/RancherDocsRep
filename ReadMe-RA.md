# Leverage main [ReadMe.md](./ReadMe.md) sections
- Purpose
- Assumptions
- Validation

# Reference Architecture variant
- At this point, you can now start editing the configuration/structure/content to to the reference enterprise architecture approach
  - NOTE: every portion of text that cites "FixMe" is a flag to encourage modification
  - in the top-level directory
    - for the default configuration/structure (chapter/section/sub-section)
      - review/edit the DAPS configuration file [DC-SA](./DC-SA)
        - uncomment the global ADOC_ATTRIBUTES+=" --attribute RA=1" line to toggle to this variant
          - then re-do the above validation step to generate the target output
        - as needed/desired, also review/edit the same section's set of ADOC_ATTRIBUTES to match what content you with to provide
  - in the main "adoc" directory
    - review/edit the [adoc/SA.adoc](./adoc/SA.adoc) main file that pulls in the selected sections
      - if the respective ADOC_ATTRIBUTES value is set (value = 1 and uncommented) in the [DC-SA](./DC-SA) file, then the conditional "ifdef" will include that content in the output
    - review/edit the [adoc/SA_vars.adoc](./adoc/SA_vars.adoc) file to change global variable settings, like
      - useCase
      - companyName
      - title (relative to your attribute setting)
      - author information
      - github references
    - review/edit the general sections, that are generally included
      - [adoc/SA-Preface.adoc](./adoc/SA-Preface.adoc) which also includes conditional EA content
        - [adoc/SA-EA-Preface.adoc](./adoc/SA-EA-Preface.adoc)
      - [adoc/SA-Summary.adoc](./adoc/SA-Summary.adoc)
    - review/edit the general sections, that your ADOC_ATTRIBUTES settings will include
      - [adoc/SA-References.adoc](./adoc/SA-References.adoc)
      - [adoc/SA-Appendix.adoc](./adoc/SA-Appendix.adoc)
      - [adoc/i/SA.adoc](./adoc/i/SA.adoc) aka Introduction
    - the corresponding layers of an enterprise architecture, which correspond to the suggested chapters, as noted below
      - [adoc/i/SA.adoc](./adoc/i/SA.adoc) aka Introduction
      - 2/ii [adoc/ii/SA-RA-BPBV.adoc](./adoc/ii/SA-RA-BPBV.adoc) ... Business problem and business value (BPBV)
      - 3/iii [adoc/iii/SA-RA-Requirements.adoc](./adoc/iii/SA-RA-Requirements.adoc)... Requirements 
      - 4/iv [adoc/iv/SA-RA-ArchOv.adoc](./adoc/iv/SA-RA-ArchOv.adoc) ... Architectural overview (ArchOv)
      - 5/v [adoc/v/SA-RA-CompMod.adoc](./adoc/v/SA-RA-CompMod.adoc) ... Component model (CompMod)
      - 6/vi [adoc/vi/SA-RA-Deployment.adoc](./adoc/vi/SA-RA-Deployment.adoc) ... Deployment (Deployment)
      - 7/vii [adoc/vii/SA-RA-DepConsiderations.adoc](./adoc/vii/SA-RA-DepConsiderations.adoc) ... Deployment considerations (DepConsiderations)
      - in each of these chapters' directories, you will notice the main SA.doc references, via ifdef, and will utilize the alternative file content from SA-RA-layerName.adoc.
        - so you don't need to edit/touch the chapter's SA.adoc
        - the relative sections/sub-sections, [DC-SA](./DC-SA) which are also based upon corresponding ADOC_ATTRIBUTES in [DC-SA](./DC-SA) will be included as well.
    - review/edit the chapter/section/sub-section content, that you wish to include
  - as you edit the modular text content snippets, create an output format
    - daps --force -d DC-SA format
      - where format might be "pdf", "html", "html --single", "epub" and others are also available
      - then review the output and continually iterate until you have your content complete
  - miscellaneous 
    - you can also add images/media content as needed in those subdirectories
    - do not forget to check in your iterations as well to have a source repository and ability to rollback to a known working state
