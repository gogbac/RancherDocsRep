== Introduction

On the digital transformation journey to a full cloud native landscape, utilization of microservices becomes the main approach with the dominant technology for such container orchestration being Kubernetes footnote:[https://kubernetes.io/]
With its large community of developers and abundant features and capabilities, Kubernetes has become the defacto standard and is included across most container-as-a-service platforms.  With all of these technologies in place, both developer and operation teams can effectively deploy, manage and deliver functionality to their end users in a resilient and agile manner.

Once on such a digital transformation journey, some of the next focus areas are:

* Workloads
** Determine how to launch either internally developed containerized, microservice workloads or leverage offerings from Independent Software Vendors ( ISV ).
endif::iISV[]

ifdef::iCSP,iIHV[]
* Compute Platform
** To optimize availability, performance, scalability and integrity, assess current system platforms or acquire and utilize new variations from:
ifdef::iIHV[]
*** Independent Hardware Vendors ( IHV ) for physical, baremetal, hypervisors and virtual machines
endif::iIHV[]
ifdef::iCSP[]
*** Cloud Service Providers ( CSP ), which can also include baremetal, virtual machines plus hosted Kubernetes services

=== Audience

This document is intended for IT decision makers, architects, system administrators and technicians who are implementing a flexible, software-defined Kubernetes

platform. One should still be familiar with the traditional IT infrastructure pillars -- networking, computing and storage -- along with the local use cases for sizing, scaling and limitations within each pillars' environments.
