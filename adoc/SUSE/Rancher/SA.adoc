Many organizations are deploying Kubernetes clusters everywhere – on-premises, in the cloud and at the edge - to unify IT operations.  Such organizations can realize dramatic benefits, including:

* Consistently deliver a high level of reliability on any infrastructure
* Improve DevOps efficiency with standardized automation
* Ensure enforcement of security policies on any infrastructure

However, relying on upstream Kubernetes alone can introduce overhead and risk because Kubernetes clusters are typically deployed:

* Without central visibility
* Without consistent security policies
* And, they must be managed independently

{pn_Rancher} is a complete cluster and container management platform built on Kubernetes itself. It addresses these challenges by delivering the following key functions, as shown in the following figure:
