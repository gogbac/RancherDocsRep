The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture of the {pn_Rancher} installation that manages multiple downstream Kubernetes clusters: 

image::ArchitectureOverview-Rancher.png[title="Architecture Overview - {pn_Rancher}", scaledwidth=80%]

Authentication Proxy::
A user is authenticated via {pn_Rancher} and then, if authorized, can access both the {pn_Rancher} environment and the downstream clusters and workloads.

API Server::
This provides the programmatic interface backend for user, command-line interactions with {pn_Rancher} and the managed clusters.

Data Store::
The purpose of this service is to capture the configuration and state of {pn_Rancher} and the managed clusters to aid in backup and recovery processes.

Cluster Controller::
Interacting with a cluster agent on the downstream cluster, the cluster controller allows the communication path for users and services to leverage for workloads and cluster management.

Once setup, users can potentially interact with {pn_Rancher} through the web-based user interface (UI), the command-line interface ( CLI ), and programatically through the application programming interface ( API ). Depending upon the assigned roles, group membership and privileges, a user could:

* manage all clusters, users, roles, projects
* deploy new clusters, import other clusters, or remove existing ones
* manage workloads across respective or labeled clusters
* simply view clusters or workloads, or just benefit from what is running

ifdef::RC,RI[]
For the best performance and security, the recommended deployment of a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for the {pn_Rancher} management server. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised. After deploying {pn_Rancher}, you can create or import clusters for running your workloads.

ifdef::GS[]
To aid in planning, training or assessing functionality like in a [<<G_PoC,proof-of-concept>>] deployment, {pn_Rancher} can be installed on a single node as described later in this document.

ifdef::BP[]
TIP: The {pn_Rancher} backup operator can then be used to migrate from the single node to an installation on a high-availability Kubernetes cluster footnote:[https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/migrating-rancher/]
endif::BP[]
endif::GS[]

NOTE: Regardless of the deployment target, {pn_Rancher} should always run on a node or cluster that is separate from the downstream clusters that it manages. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised.
